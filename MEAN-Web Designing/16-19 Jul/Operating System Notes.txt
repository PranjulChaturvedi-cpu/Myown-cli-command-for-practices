Q.1- How many ways can you operate computer?
Ans: we've following two ways to operate computers:
  A. GUI - Graphical User Interface - Using certain graphics     (images,      animation, others), you can operate computer.others word: we      communicate with computer just by seeing and clicking those      application or with help of application, wecommunicate to the      computer.

GUI:	                                      HW(Binary Lang: 101010
USER--->App(VLC/Whatsapp/Notepad)--->OS---CLI-->| RAM + PROCESSOR|

  B. CLI - Command Line Interface: using commands, we communite with      computer, it introduced when computer came to market first time.
   Why CLI as A Developer:
   1. As compare to GUI, your CLI is much faster.

CLI: 
                                          HW(Binary Lang)
USER----->CLI(Commands in English)----->| RAM + PROCESSOR |

  2. As a backend developer, we must have knowledge of CLI as on     production logs msg and other important msg are being displayed in     form CLI.
  3. if you want to work with server you must have knowledge of cli.


Where does it exist in your computer: how to open cli(command prompt)
to open: Window + R(RUN) --> type cmd and hit enter.

Q.2: Once you know CLI is better for developer, what are the common operations/task, you commonly do with computer using GUI?
   1. open folder, open any application
   2. install application, uninstall application
   3. copy folder and move folder
   4. watch videos, play songs

all above mentions task, you can easily do with CLI using commands(set of english words).
